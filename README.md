# ScholarMind - AI-Powered Academic Research Assistant with Context-Aware RAG
## Objective

Develop an intelligent web application that assists students and researchers in navigating academic literature, synthesizing information, and generating insights using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), transformer models, and real-time collaboration tools.

## Why This Project?

1. **Real-World Problem**: Academic research is time-consuming, and students often struggle to find relevant papers, understand dense content, or connect ideas across domains.
2. **Innovation**: Combines RAG (for dynamic retrieval) with fine-tuned transformers (for summarization, Q&A, and cross-paper analysis) and collaborative features.
3. **Profile Impact**:
    - **AI/ML Developer**: Work with RAG pipelines, NLP, model fine-tuning, and vector databases.
    - **Full-Stack Developer**: Build a scalable MERN app with real-time features, API integrations, and data visualization.

## Core Features

1. **Context-Aware Research Query Engine**
    - Users input natural language queries (e.g., "Explain transformers in NLP with applications to healthcare").
    - **RAG Pipeline**:
      - Retrieve papers from arXiv, PubMed, or CrossRef APIs.
      - Use a vector database (e.g., FAISS/Pinecone) to index embeddings of papers.
      - Augment GPT-3.5/4 or Llama 2 with retrieved context for accurate, citation-backed answers.

2. **Multi-Paper Synthesis Tool**
    - Upload multiple PDFs. The AI identifies connections, generates a comparative summary, and creates a visual knowledge graph.
    - **ML Component**: Fine-tune a BERT-based model for cross-document relationship extraction.

## Tech Stack

### AI/ML Layer

- **RAG Pipeline**: Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, Pinecone.
- **Models**: Fine-tune GPT-3/4 or Llama 2 on academic text (arXiv dataset).
- **NLP Tasks**: Summarization (BART), Q&A (RoBERTa), clustering (scikit-learn).

### Full-Stack Layer (MERN)

- **Frontend**: React + Redux for dynamic UI, D3.js for knowledge graphs.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with WebSocket for real-time collaboration.
- **Database**: MongoDB (user data, paper metadata), Firebase (PDF storage).
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS EC2, or Heroku with NGINX.

## Key Definitions (Simplified)

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

- **What it is**: A technique where an AI model (like GPT) retrieves relevant information from a database/documents before generating an answer.
- **Why use it?**: Standard chatbots generate answers from pre-trained knowledge, which can be outdated or generic. RAG adds fresh, domain-specific data to the AI’s response, making answers accurate and citation-backed.

### Transformer Models

- **What it is**: A type of neural network architecture (e.g., GPT, BERT) that processes sequences of data (like text).
- **Why use it?**: Excels at understanding context and is used for tasks like summarization, Q&A, and text generation.

### Vector Database

- **What it is**: A database that stores data as vectors (arrays of numbers representing meaning).
- **Why use it?**: Finds papers with similar semantic meaning rather than just keyword matches.
- **Tools**: Pinecone, FAISS, or ChromaDB.

### Context-Aware RAG Pipeline

- **In this project**:
  - Retrieves relevant academic papers from a vector database.
  - Augments the AI’s knowledge with these papers.
  - Generates an answer that cites specific sources.

## How the App Works (User Flow)

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User Input**: A student types a query: "Summarize recent breakthroughs in cancer detection using AI."
2. **RAG Pipeline Activation**:
    - **Step 1 (Retrieval)**: The app searches a vector database of academic papers and finds the most relevant papers using semantic similarity.
    - **Step 2 (Augmentation)**: The retrieved papers’ text is fed into a transformer model.
    - **Step 3 (Generation)**: The AI generates a summary using both its general knowledge and the retrieved papers.
3. **Output**: A structured answer with a summary of breakthroughs, citations, and a knowledge graph showing connections between concepts.

## RAG Pipeline Breakdown

1. **Retrieve papers from APIs**: Use APIs like arXiv or PubMed to fetch academic papers.
2. **Vector database indexing**: Convert paper text into embeddings and store these embeddings in a vector database.
3. **Augment GPT with context**: Combine the retrieved papers’ text with the query and feed this combined context to GPT to generate an answer.

## Simplified Tech Stack (What’s Used Where)

### AI/ML Layer

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Run pre-trained models.
- **LangChain**: Simplify building the RAG pipeline.
- **Pinecone/FAISS**: Store and search vector embeddings of papers.

### Full-Stack Layer (MERN)

- **React (Frontend)**: Build the UI for queries, displaying summaries, graphs, and citations.
- **Node.js/Express (Backend)**: Handle API requests.
- **MongoDB**: Store user data.

### Deployment

- **Docker**: Containerize the app.
- **AWS EC2/Heroku**: Host the web app.

## Scaled-Down Version Suggestions

- **Focus on Core Features First**: Build the RAG-powered query engine.
- **Use Pre-Trained Models**: Avoid fine-tuning models early on.
- **Simplify the Vector Database**: Start with FAISS.
- **Use Existing APIs**: Fetch papers directly from arXiv API.
